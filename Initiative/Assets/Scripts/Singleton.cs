/* NAME:            Singleton.cs
 * AUTHOR:          Shinlynn Kuo, Yu-Che Cheng (Jeffrey), Hamza Awad, Emmilio Segovia
 * DESCRIPTION:     This is to be inherited to enforce the singleton pattern. Derived classes should
 * 				    implement 'protected T () []' as an empty constructor to prevent the 'new'
 * 				    keyword from being used. It is abstract.
 * REQUIREMENTS:    Any reference to a Singleton Instance should be made in Start() instead of Awake()
 * 				    to allow all Awakes to finish establishing all Singletons
